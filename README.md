## Problem Statement ##
Geekdemy provides a wide variety of online education programmes. Students can purchase them and enroll in these programmes. 
Geekdemy offers attractive discounts through their coupons so that students can spend less while purchasing these programmes.

## Programmes ##

 There are 3 different categories of online programmes, and the cost is different for each category. A student can purchase any number of programmes at a time.
 
 * CERTIFICATION - Rs.3000 
 * DEGREE - Rs. 5000 
 * DIPLOMA - Rs 2500

## Coupons ##

 The discount coupons offered by Geekdemy are based on different criteria. Only one discount coupon can be applied at a time.
 
*  B4G1 - This coupon is applied automatically if 4 or more programmes are being purchased. The student gets one programme for free. The lowest priced programme is given for FREE.
 
 * DEAL_G20 - This coupon can be applied if the purchased programmes value is Rs.10,000/- or above. It provides a 20% discount on the total programme cost. The coupon needs to be applied explicitly to get a discount.
 
*  DEAL_G5 - This coupon can only be applied if there are a minimum of 2 programmes being purchased. It provides a 5% discount on the total programme cost. The coupon needs to be applied explicitly to get a discount.
 
## Enrollment Fee ##

 If the total programme cost is below Rs. 6666/, an extra enrollment fee Rs.500/- is added to the cart. The enrollment fee is applied after the discount. If the total programme cost is or above Rs.6666/- the enrollment fee is waived off.
 
## Pro Membership Fee ##

 A student can choose to purchase a Pro Membership for a small amount of Rs.200/- . The pro membership provides an additional membership discount on each of the individual programmes on top of the other discounts.
 
 * DIPLOMA - 1% discount

## Goal ##
 Build a command-line application to purchase different kinds of programmes from Geekdemy. The application should generate 
 a total bill of the programmes after applying the discounts, if any.
